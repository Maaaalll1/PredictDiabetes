# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately diagnose whether a patient has diabetes or not. The dataset utilized is sourced from Kaggle's [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), containing information about Pima Indian women's health parameters, lifestyle factors, and medical history.

## Contents

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and model training.
- `data/`: Includes the dataset file related to diabetes prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists necessary Python packages for running the code.

## Dataset Source

The dataset consists of 768 observations with 8 features including:
- Number of pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Triceps skin fold thickness
- Insulin level
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Outcome (1 for diabetes, 0 for no diabetes)

Refer to the dataset's documentation and licensing terms for usage restrictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
